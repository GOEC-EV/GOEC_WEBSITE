Jafar&apos;s unwavering commitment and strong focus on renewable energy, green farming, and sustainable infrastructure have changed the way we think about eco-friendly projects.In a world dealing with ongoing environmental challenges, some people truly stand out for their strong commitment to a greener planet. A.P. Jafar is one such visionary who has devoted his life to the dream of a more eco-friendly future.
As the founder and chairman of several companies, Jafar has taken the lead in championing initiatives that promote renewable energy, green farming, and sustainable infrastructure. At the core of Jafar&apos;s mission is a profound desire to transform our planet into a greener and more sustainable haven. Summing up his vision is his mantra, &quot;We are a densely populated place, so use more renewable energy to conserve the planet&quot;.
Guided by his dream, he embarked on a journey aimed at transforming the renewable energy landscape in India. The path to success is rarely smooth, and Kerala, the starting point of Jafar&apos;s journey, posed its own set of challenges with intense competition making expansion an uphill task.
However, a pivotal moment unfolded during his visit to China in 2017. Exploring Guangzhou, a city emblematic of transformation, stirred a newfound inspiration. Witnessing the remarkable achievements in China ignited a belief within him  if the Chinese could accomplish such feats, so could he.
Jafar&apos;s ventures are broad and impactful. He established GO EC Autotech Pvt Ltd, a network of EV charging stations in India, promoting the widespread use of electric vehicles. Through CoazaDPower On Pvt Ltd, his green energy company, he focuses on large wind turbines and hydro projects, tapping into nature&apos;s power for sustainable energy generation. Vayu One Power On Pvt Ltd further underscores his dedication to renewable energy sources.In the construction industry, he initiated Team Azad Builtech LLP, which has erected numerous structures, including high-rise buildings, convention centres, hospitals, and apartments in Kerala. This company not only generates numerous job opportunities for both Keralites and non-Keralites but also indirectly supports many small-scale business owners. Undoubtedly, this initiative contributes significantly to our state&apos;s revenue through taxes.
